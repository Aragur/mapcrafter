Important things:
	- add all blocks
	- better documentation
	
Blocks:
#	- a lot of blocks (grass, torches, transparent leaves,...) have some transparency on 
#	  their edges after resizing, could be a performance problem
#	  - maybe use simple nearest neighbor resizing for transparent blocks
	- fix east ascending stairs texture bug
	
Other things:
	- performance and ram improvements are always good
	- composite tile rendering also multithreaded
	- biome depend grass/leaves/water color?
	- maybe more rendermodes?
