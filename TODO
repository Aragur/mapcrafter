TODO:
	- add all blocks
	- better documentation
	
Blocks:
	- piston extension
	- redstone
	- sign post / wall sign
	- lever
	- pumpkin / melon stem
	- dragon egg
	- tripwire / -hook
	- cobblestone wall
	- flower pot
	- heads
	- anvil
	
	- properly beacon
	- corner stairs?
	
Other things:
	- performance and ram improvements are always good
	- composite tile rendering also multithreaded
	  - maybe create tile tree, then get subtrees of the same size for the threads
	    to render then everything recursively by a few threads
	- biome depend grass/leaves/water color?
	- maybe more rendermodes?
