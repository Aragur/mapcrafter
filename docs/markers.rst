Markers
=======

You can add your own map markers by editing the file ``markers.js`` in the output
directory.  This is a Javascript file where you can add markers to your maps.
There are a few examples of markers in the default ``markers.js`` file.  When you
render your map for the first time the renderer copies this default marker file
to your output directory.  The renderer does not copy the file if it already
exists in the output directory, so you can have your markers in the output
directory file.

If you want player markers from your Minecraft Server on your map, please have a look
at the `mapcrafter-playermarkers <https://github.com/m0r13/mapcrafter-playermarkers>`_
project.
